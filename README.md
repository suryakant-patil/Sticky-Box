Sticky-Box

Sticky floating animated box using CSS transform and JS

This code makes it possible to have a fixed position element that is relative to it’s parent. A normal fixed positioned element would be “out of context” and is very difficult to use in the most common situations with fluid designs. This Code solves that problem with as little code as I could possible get it so it will run in the most optimized way, while also allow you to customize it in many important ways which might suit you best.

Not using CSS position absolute and fixed So Responsive layout you can make any element floatable. You can also Stick element in between boundaries.
